# Analysis of Quality of Life in the US from 1984-2019
We all know and understand that the quality of life has significantly improved over the past couple of decades. But, what do trends, numbers, and statistics have to show about this fact? Although quality of life is inherently a subjective measure of an individual’s well-being, we have developed a general definition that analyzes standards of living in the United States from the years of 1984 to 2019. We will analyze housing prices, usage of SNAP food benefits, life expectancy, cereal production, and GDP. It is anticipated that these values slowly improve throughout the decades, but are there any surprising trends that we may find to tell us something that isn’t shown with numbers alone?

This project is a completed Shiny App of the analysis of the quality of life in the US from 1984-2019 by data wrangling and using visualization techniques.
